/*
 lightFinder Algorithm:

 1. Find the balance
    Req: print to serial (for humans)
    Rval - Lval = Difference (it probably won't be zero*)
    *Define some offset at the top
    Circuit Note: The higher the resistor (10k) the higher the sensor values
    
 2. Calculate light source values
    Note: Must find a range of tolerance (Deadband, defined as a constant at the top -> define DEADBAND 20;
    If it moves outside of the 20, then start moving the servo's position  
    


 3. Send position to the servo
